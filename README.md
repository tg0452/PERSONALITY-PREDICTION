# PERSONALITY-PREDICTION
Compiler Design
Personality prediction is an area of research that aims to identify and understand individual
differences in human behavior, thought patterns, and emotions. It involves the use of various
tools and methods, including psychological assessments, behavioral observation, and
computational modeling, to predict and describe a person's unique personality traits and
characteristics. This field has applications in a wide range of domains, including clinical
psychology, organizational behavior, and social psychology. Understanding and predicting
personality can lead to insights into how individuals interact with others, make decisions, and
cope with stress and adversity. With the development of social networks, a large variety of
approaches have been developed to define users' personalities based on their social activities
and language use habits. Lately, there has been a massive spike up in the number of social
network users. There is a massive evolution of social media platforms which have led to
massive data generation. With this available data, there are large variations of methods to
define personality of the users’ based on their social behavior and patterns. With the aid of
machine learning model and data-sets the main aim of this paper is to predict the
Myers–Briggs type Indicator (MBTI) personality type of the twitter user. The Myers-Briggs
type Indicator is probably the maximum widely used personality check within the world. The
predictor will help to predict 1 of 16 different personalities of the user based on their Twitter
account. The text is preprocessed to get clean. After tokenizing of the data, machine learning
model - LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Networks) has been built. The predictor
endeavors to get of the personality type, traits and careers suitability.
